## Conflict Resolution Explanation

### Conflict Encountered:
The conflict occurred when merging the `feature-branch` into `main`. Both branches modified the same section of the `index.html` file, which resulted in a conflict.

### How the Conflict Was Resolved:
I reviewed the conflicting changes and decided to combine them logically. The changes from both branches were integrated into one final version of the file, and the conflict markers were removed.

### Commit:
After resolving the conflict, I committed the changes and pushed them to the `main` branch. The commit message was: `"Resolved merge conflict in index.html"`.
